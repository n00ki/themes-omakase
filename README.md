# 🍣 Themes Omakase

A collection of my custom themes, **inspired by great theme design work and tuned to my own aesthetic preferences**.
Each theme lives in its own folder, with versions for different IDEs and accompanying screenshots.

Currently available for:

- **Zed**
- **VSCode**

## 🌌 Vika

A grounded, **earthy utilitarian** dark theme, built as a fusion of two inspirations:
- [**Vesper**](https://github.com/raunofreiberg/vesper) by _Rauno Freiberg_
- [**Kanagawa.nvim**](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) by _Tommaso Laurenzi (rebelot)_

## 🌙 In Bed by 8pm

A cozy, dreamy dark theme with **pastel accents** and a relaxed vibe.
Based on *In Bed by 7pm* by [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras), extended and refined with my own palette and tweaks.
